My solutions to problems on [Code-Golf](https://code-golf.io).

The website accepts only a fixed set of programming language
as solution, including [J](https://www.jsoftware.com/). Unfortunately
I am only interested in creating my solution in [APL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APL_(programming_language))
using [NARS2000](http://www.nars2000.org/). So I am posting / sharing my answers here instead.
